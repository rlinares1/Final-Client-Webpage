					The San Diego Chicken began his reign when he was created as a
					cartoon character for KGB-FM Radio. A man named Ted Giannoulas
					became the mascot for the San Diego Padres in March 1974. The mascot
					is known for being one of the most controversal and one of the funniest
					mascots of any baseball team.

					The San Diego Chicken has done various pranks and the mascot usually
					interrupts some games with these pranks. The mascot is known to visit
					players and umpires in the middle of games, distracting them. The
					chicken also has his trademark dance moves that he is also largely
					known for. There was a case where when Ted Giannoulas retired, he sued 
					the new guy in the mascot costume for stealing his dance moves.
